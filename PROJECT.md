A restful application should be implemented where users can send messages to each other and read their incoming and sent messages. 
All related entities should be implemented.

It will be enough if the message contains the following fields;
- sender
- receiver
- subject
- content
- sent date

It should be a restful application, no ui needed. The required endpoints are

- Send message
- list incoming messages of a user
- list sent messages by a user
- read message details
- an endpoint to estimate the number of total messages that will be sent probably for the rest of the day
- an endpoint to estimate the number of total messages that will be sent probably for the rest of the week

It should be a “spring boot” application, "Mongodb" should be used as the database and "gradle" as the build tool. 
Besides that you can use any libraries or frameworks that you want. Unit tests and integration tests should be written as well.

Project should be put in GitHub.
